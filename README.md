Practice Data Wrangling with pandas and numpy

## Pandas
Pandas is a Python library extensively used for data analysis and manipulation. It provides data structures like DataFrames, which are similar to tables, and Series, which are like lists or columns in a table. These structures allow for efficient handling and processing of structured data. Pandas is built on top of NumPy and integrates well with other scientific computing libraries. It simplifies tasks such as data cleaning, transformation, and analysis, making it a fundamental tool for data scientists and analysts.

### Installing and Importing Pandas
Installing Pandas
```
pip install pandas
```
### Creating Series and Pandas Data Frame
#### 1. Creating Series
 A Pandas Series is a one-dimensional labeled array capable of holding data of any type. It is similar to a column in a spreadsheet or a SQL table. The labels for the Series are collectively known as the index. A Series can be created from a variety of data types, including lists, dictionaries, and NumPy arrays. 

## Data Loading and Inspection
### Reading Data
A simple way to store big data is to use CSV files (comma Seperated files) or Parquet Files. 
- df_sales --> computed_insight_success_of_active_sellers.csv'
- df_product --> summer-products-with-rating-and-performance_2020-08.csv
